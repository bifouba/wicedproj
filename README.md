# wicedproj â€” Wittgenstein Centre Education Projections

The `wicedproj` R package contains code implementing the projection model of educational attainment
of the [Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital](http://www.wittgensteincentre.org/en/index.htm). 

The projections from this package have been used in the Global Education Monitoring 2016 among others,
and in particular the publication:

Abel G.J., Barakat B., KC S., and Lutz W. 2016. Meeting the Sustainable Development Goals leads to lower world population growth. Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. doi:10.1073/pnas.1611386113 [(code)](http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/WorldPopulation/SDG_Scenarios_2016.html)

In its appendix, Abel et al. (2016) also includes a narrative description of key assumptions and features of the education projection model implemented here.


# Installation

Using the `devtools` package:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bifouba/wicedproj")
```

Note that you require a working development environment, since some code requires compilation at run-time.
Setting this up is somewhat platform-dependent and cannot be covered exhaustively here.
However, helpful starting points are available in the documentation for the `devtools` and `rstan` packages.


# Usage

An example script is included in the `inst/script` directory 
(after installation, this gets moved up one level to `script` directly under the root directory). 
This estimation makes use of an extract of the Wittgenstein Centre's [database](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/dataexplorer/) of reconstructed educational attainment time series that is included with the `wicedproj` package in CSV format.

Because the full estimation is computationally intensive (running approx. 5 hours per scenario on my system),
a much faster "testing" mode can be enabled (that runs only a single Markov Chain for a small number of iterations) 
by setting the corresponding option:

```R
wicedproj_options(testing = TRUE)
```

The actual numerical estimates from such runs are obviously to be ignored.
